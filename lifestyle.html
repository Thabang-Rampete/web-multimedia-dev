      <div class="tour">
        <img src="images/colosseum.jpg" alt="Colosseum">
      </div>
      <p>The Colosseum is a <strong>must-visit</strong> tourist destination when in Rome. This ancient structure dates
        back to 72 A.D. and 80 A.D. when it was used as an arena for gladiator battles. It measures 189 metres in
        length, 156 metres in width and 50 metres in height, making it the largest amphitheater in the world. Not only
        did gladiators fight here, but animals such as tigers and lions as well. It was a great source of entertainment
        for the Romans and a source of income as well because they would always bet on who would win. Much of it, was
        destroyed by natural disasters such as a earthquakes, which are evident today.</p><br>

      <h3>2. The Catacombs</h3>
      <div class="tour">
        <img src="images/catacombs.jpg" alt="Catacombs">
      </div>
      <p>One other places you should visit are the Roman Catacombs. It may not be the most exciting, but it does have
        its history, for those interested. The catacombs were used as an underground burial site that dates back from
        the second to the fifth century, and were primarily used by Christians and Jews. The reason they were built was
        because Christians did not believe in the tradition/custom of cremation, so they constructed underground
        passegeways were they would lay the dead. Their bodies were wrapped in a sheet and placed in the niches, which
        were then covered with a gravestone made up of either marble or baked clay.</p><br>

        <img src="images/basilica.jpg" alt="Basilica">
      </div>
      <p>St. Peter's Basilica, one of the largest churches in the world located in a very small country, Vatican City,
        in Rome.The story of this majestic religious palace, begins with the crucifixion of Peter, one of the apostles
        of Jesus Christ, in 64 AD. He was crucified upside down on a cross in Circus of Nero, and buried nearby on a
        place that is now known as the Vatican Hill. An Emperor by name of 'Constantine The Great', built the Old
        Basilica church between 319 AD and 333 AD on the burial spot of St. Peter. Later on, in the 16th Century by the
        order of Pope Julius II, the current St. Peter’s Basilica church was built.</p><br>

        located at the heart of Rome, in the Apostolic Palace. It was built between 1473 and 1481 and takes its name
        from Pope Sixtus IV. <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> It is where Pope Francis resides. What also makes this place
        iconic is its paintings, which were done by Renaissance painters which include the likes of Cosimo Rosselli,

      <p>Last on our list we have the Roman Forum. This was the site for the social, political and religious activities
        in ancient Rome. Legend has it that it was founded by brothers Romulus and Remus in 753 B.C. when they ruled
        side by side. It was extended by Julius Caesar & Augustus when too many people crowded there. The Forum included
        structures such as the Council House, Temple of Vestra, The Rostra and Temple of Saturn. </p><br>
