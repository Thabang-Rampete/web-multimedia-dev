      <h1>Best Places To Shop In Rome</h1><br>

      <p>Also: <a href="restaurants.html" id="res-link">See the best restuarants in Rome</a></p><br>

      <h3>1. Via Dei Condotti</h3><br>
      <p>This is the one stop shopping location for the best shopping experience. This popular street is well known for
        the designer shopping outlets in the vicinity, such as Dolce & Gabbana, Dior and Gucci. If you are ever looking
        to buy some designer clothes, especially designer bags, then this is the place for you.</p><br>

      <h3>2. La Rinascente</h3><br>
      <p>As in the name, La Rinascente, is home to one of the multi-brand luxury store which houses everything from
        branded cosmetics to home decor.</p><br>

      <h3>3. Via Cola Di Rienzo</h3><br>
      <p>Luxury is not everything even if it is in the fashion capital of the world. For those who do not plan on going
        luxury shopping but still want a taste of fashion in Roma, then Via Cola Di Rienzo is the place for you. It is a
        popular street amongst the locals which offers a mix of some Italian and international brands.</p><br>

      <h3>4. Via del Governo Vecchio</h3><br>
      <p>A shopping spree in Roma would not be complete if you do not take a peak at the jewellery and antiquites. While
        they may not be the shiniest and overly spectecular, it is one place that you should check out, especially the
        boutiques and jewellery stores. </p><br>

      <h3>5. Spanish Steps</h3><br>
      <p>If you think that your trip to Rome simply won’t be complete without splurging on a real Fendi purse, a bauble
        of Gucci or a wallet from Prada, then look no further than the streets fanning out from Piazza di Spagna (most
        famously known as the Spanish Steps). The amount of credit card debt that gets run up on Via Condotti, Via
        Borgognona, Via del Babuino and Via Frattina, is a little woorying since all the big players are there.</p><br>

      <h3>6. Via Margutta</h3><br>
      <p>Next on the list is a place known not for the clothing retailers it has, but for art galleries. This is the
        place to be for all those who appreciate art, and the best part of it all is that is affordable shopping.</p>
      <br>

      <h3>7. Castel Romano</h3><br>
      <p>Castel Romano, which might as well be a go to place for a lot of people, is a shopping outlet which offers
        famous designer brands like Michael Kors, Roberto Cavalli, Nike, and more at 30 to 70% off throughout the year.
        What more could you ask for! </p><br>

      <h3>8. Monti</h3><br>
      <p>Last but not least, we have Monti. While it might not have the best retail designer outlets, it certainly
        boasts its fair share of designer clothes from upcoming designers. The streets of Monti are also lined up with
        resale shops, bijou jewellers and the studio-storefronts</p><br>
