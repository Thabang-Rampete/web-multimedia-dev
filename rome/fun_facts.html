<h1>Ten Fun Facts About Rome</h1><br>

<p>1. The Romans ginvented the calendar. In 46 B.C. when Julius Caesar was in Alexandria, he was in awe at their calendar which was based on the solar year. After Caesar’s trip he incorporated the new Julian calendar which would be 365 days with an extra day at the end of February every 4 years – hence the leap year! It wasn’t until after Caesars death that a month was named after him and that month was July, which was named Quintilius.</p><br>

<p>2. Rome is the only city in the world that has another country inside it. The Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world that spans an area of just 44 hectares in the heart of Rome. It is governed by the Pope and has a population of just over 800, its own army and even its own currency.</p><br>

<p>3. Ancient Rome was home to the largest stadium ever built, and it wasn’t the Colosseum. It was The Circus Maximus. Because the Romans were obsessed with entertainment, chariot racing being the most popular, it was done in the The Circus. Back in the 2nc century A.D., it was estimated that Circus Maximus could hold 250,000 people when they were racing.</p><br>

<p>4. The Romans sometimes flooded the whole Colosseum or Circus Maximus for a boat battle.</p><br>

<p>5. Women in ancient Rome used to dye their hair with goat fat and beech wood ashes. </p><br>

<p>6. Rome Hosted the 1960 Summer Olympics.</p><br>

<p>7. The Romans worshipped hundreds of gods for such as, Mars, Roman God of War, Jupiter, king of the gods etc... for different reasons. They even went as far as adopting gods from other cultures like the Greek and Egyptian gods and renamed them. </p><br>

<br>8. Rome has more churches than any other city in the world. Within the ancient city walls of Rome are 300+ churches, but the number in the extended city is over 900. This may not come as a surprise considering that Rome is the heart of Christianity.</p><br>

<p>9. The Colosseum of Rome is one of the Seven Wonders of the World</p><br>

<p>10. Gambling was popular in ancient Rome. Whether it was betting on their favourite Charioteer at the Circus Maximus or their favourite gladiator in the Colossem, the Romans loved to gamble. Not only did that, but they cheated too!</p><br>
